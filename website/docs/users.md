A few systems are using nanopublications to store informations.

## Web services

- **[Knowledge Collaboratory](https://collaboratory.semanticscience.org)**: a service to help annotate biomedical claims, publish the annotations as nanopublications, and browse nanopublications.

* **[Data Stewardship Wizard](https://ds-wizard.org/)**: publish [FAIR implementation profiles](https://www.go-fair.org/how-to-go-fair/fair-implementation-profile/) as nanopublications?

## Libraries

* [**fairworkflows**](https://github.com/fair-workflows/fairworkflows): a python library for constructing, modifying and publishing scientific workflows described using semantic technologies.
