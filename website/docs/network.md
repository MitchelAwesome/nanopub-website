Nanopublications are published in a **decentralized network of servers**. This network is composed of multiple nanopublications servers deployed at various locations, such as universities, cf. [example server](https://np.petapico.org/) / [paper 1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.2749) / [paper 2](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.78) ([server code](https://github.com/tkuhn/nanopub-server) / [monitor code](https://github.com/tkuhn/nanopub-monitor/))

You can **see all servers** in the nanopublications network by accessing the [**nanopub monitor**](http://purl.org/nanopub/monitor) ([monitor code](https://github.com/tkuhn/nanopub-monitor/))

Each nanopublication server is composed of 3 core services:
- Nanopub API: [instance 1](http://grlc.nanopubs.lod.labs.vu.nl/api/local/local/) / [instance 2](http://130.60.24.146:7881/api/local/local/)
- Tapas interface: [instance 1](http://grlc.nanopubs.lod.labs.vu.nl/tapas/tapas.html) / [instance 2](http://130.60.24.146:7881/tapas/tapas.html)
- Quad Pattern Fragments: [instance 1](http://ldf.nanopubs.lod.labs.vu.nl/np) / [instance 2](http://130.60.24.146:7882/np)

And there are **validators** for nanopublications: [instance 1](https://nanopub.petapico.org/) / [instance 2](http://app.tkuhn.eculture.labs.vu.nl/nanopub-validator/) ([code](https://github.com/tkuhn/nanopub-validator))
