How nanopublications are formatted is specified in the [Nanopublication Guidelines, latest working draft](http://nanopub.org/guidelines/working_draft/).

The machine-readable description of nanopublications is defined in RDF by the [Nanopublication Schema](http://nanopub.org/nschema).

For comments and contributions about those guidelines, please join us at [Github](https://github.com/Nanopublication/Guidelines).
