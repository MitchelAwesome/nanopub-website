## ‚úíÔ∏è Markdown tips

### Add an announcement top bar

You can easily add a general announcement bar on the website if you want to pass some information to your users, like dates of maintenance

Open the file `website/docusaurus.config.js` and update the `announcementBar` variable.

You can comment the `announcementBar` code block when you want to remove the announcement bar.

### Info boxes

Embed a Google docs presentation (size does not change dynamically). You can check the ["documentation" by gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/markdown-guide/#google-slides) but it does not work (how can they expect to get a responsive website by providing hardcoded pixel size?):

```html
<figure class="video_container">
  <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRAfZdOfGt761tIAj2e35OYrOL4uIKWiAQB15MXvsqso3XJ5Mr3-W4dOa9KjDTZpi1LE_D2CU1F5Thy/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=15000" frameborder="0" width="960" height="569" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
</figure>

# With CSS:
<script>
.video-container{
  position: absolute;
  top: 0%;
  left: 0%;
  height: 100%;
  width: 100%;
  /* overflow: hidden; */
}
</script>
```
