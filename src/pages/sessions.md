# Nano Sessions

The Nano Sessions connect the people who are interested in nanopublications and who want to learn from each other about the related technologies. Every session has two talks, discussion and a news sharing part. Knowledge Pixels hosts the first meetings, but we are happy to let others join and become hosts too. For more information on the Nano Sessions see [the notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-0aImR4bFHmay8j6bSFgIDi9sw01KXdmYw9szyhAWmY/edit#). 
Do you have someone in mind that could be interested in nanopublications? The meetings are open to everyone and invitations are sent out via [our mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/nanopub-users/).

All sessions are in [this Zoom channel](https://vu-live.zoom.us/j/97176002956?pwd=UHh5MGJWNHpEcFZKbTA0Kzcrc29TQT09). Anyone can join without registration.
